/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a collaborative, session-based security model for a multiplayer game.
 * The primary security boundary is the Game Session. A user's access rights are determined
 * by their participation in a specific game session. Static game data (like cards and boss
 * encounters) is publicly readable to allow clients to load game assets easily, but is
 * not client-writable to protect game integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All dynamic game data is nested under the `/game_sessions/{gameSessionId}` path. This
 * includes players, the shared nation state, and cards dealt for that session. This
 * structure ensures that all data related to a single game is colocated, simplifying
 * security rules and queries. Static game assets are stored in top-level collections
 * like `/decision_cards` and `/boss_encounters`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Session Membership is Required: To read or write any data within a specific game
 *   session, the requesting user MUST be a participant in that game.
 * - Public Read for Game Lobbies: All signed-in users can list game sessions to find and
 *   join a game, but they cannot see the internal details of a session until they join.
 * - Static Data is Read-Only: Core game definitions are public but immutable from the client-side.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To enable this security model, a critical denormalization pattern is REQUIRED. Each
 * `/game_sessions/{gameSessionId}` document MUST contain a `players` map that stores the
 * UIDs of all participants (e.g., `{ players: { 'uid1': 'host', 'uid2': 'member' } }`).
 * This allows security rules for any subcollection document (like players or nation_state)
 * to perform a single, fast `get()` on the parent game session to verify the user's
 * membership before granting access. This avoids impossible-to-secure queries and is
 * essential for the rules to function correctly.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The design separates dynamic, session-specific data (under `/game_sessions`) from static,
 * global game data (`/decision_cards`, `/boss_encounters`). This segregation creates a clear
 * and secure boundary, allowing for simple, performant rules that make static assets
 * public while strictly controlling access to active game state.
